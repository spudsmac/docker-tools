Web GUI for managing Nagios monitoring service.

### Usage

NagiosQL is a UI for managing host, service and related definitions for Nagios. In May 2018 it was finally updated to work with Nagios Core v4.x. Here in this codebase find an example [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/nagiosql/docker-compose.yml) which will launch 3 services: the jasonrivers/nagios image, this NagiosQL image and an nginx server which provides SSL termination.

Steps:
* Create a blank database (e.g. nagiosql) or a copy of your existing NagiosQL database on your MySQL server and assign its password in the docker secret identified in your docker-compose.yml (see example as noted above)
* Copy the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/nagiosql/docker-compose.yml) from this repo and define any environment-var overrides you might need (as defined below)
* Bring up Nagios4 and NagiosQL using `docker-compose up`
* In a browser, connect to NagiosQL UI at the port number identified in docker-compose.yml, log in as nagiosadmin / nagios, enter the database install or update dialog
* Define hosts, services and other objects
* Under Tools -> Nagios control, invoke Write monitoring data, Write additional data, Check configuration files
* Restart nagios server if the configuration check passed

Tips:
* (To secure nagios itself) use htpasswd (provided in the jasonrivers image), add your administrative user(s) to htpasswd.users at top level in nagios_etc volume, and update cgi.cfg to include user name(s) in each of the authorized_xxx settings
* Nagios v4 requires that each service be attached to at least one host or hostgroups. If you're migrating from an old installation, deactivate any service definitions that are no longer in use

### Current Status

Alpha--the only known issue is the restart button doesn't work (a workaround is to invoke docker restart of the nagios container). Not verified under kubernetes (on the theory that fewer dependencies are better for the lowest-level monitoring system during any outage).
